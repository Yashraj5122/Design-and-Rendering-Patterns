# Design-and-Rendering-Patterns

## Design Pattern
Design patterns are reusable solutions to common software design problems that arise during the development process. They 
provide a structured approach to design and help in creating maintainable, scalable, and flexible software systems.

## Rendering Pattern

Rendering refers to the process of generating the final output from data stored in a computer memory or transmitted over a 
network. In software development, rendering is commonly associated with the presentation layer of an application, where data is 
transformed into a visual format that users can perceive and interact with.

Immediate Mode Rendering is a application of Rendering Pattern which is a real-time applications for gaming, where rendering 
performance and responsiveness are critical. Immediate mode rendering allows for rapid updates and interactivity, making it 
well-suited for dynamic and fast-paced environments.
